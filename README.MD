# Will It Flood?

## What
This application lets residents of the state of Florida enter their address and view a calendar of dates for the highest high tides, known as the King Tides, in their area. Users may adjust the height of what they wish to identify as King Tides from 2.5 feet to 5.0 feet. The default is 2.5 feet.

#### Status
We are still working on the fucntionality. Our soft launch is September 2017, our official launch is October 12, 2017. [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cfpb/ckan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

#### Press
We do not have any press about this project yet, but an earlier FIU project developed in conjunction with Code for Miami has had a lot of press.

## Why
A more in detail explanation for why this project exists. Tell us all about it.

## Who
This project is a collaboration of Florida International University's College of Communication, Architecture and the Arts and Code for Miami. Dr. Susan Jacobson, a professor in FIU's School of Communication & Journalism and a long-time member of Code for Miami, is the lead, but many members of Code for Miami have significantly contributed to this project, including:
* Pablo Barria
* Chris Scott
* Bryce Kerley
* Julie Kramer
* Yamileth Medina
* Ernie Hsuing

## How
#### Dependencies
This application draws upon data from annual tide predictions posted by NOAA: https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html?gid=1397#listing. As of July 2017, we have data that goes through the end of the year. Links to other [How To's](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto) will help.

#### Install
You should install the following:
* index.html
* tides folder
* css folder
* js folder
* images folder

See [the CfAPI](https://github.com/codeforamerica/cfapi#installation) for an example.

#### Deploy
More required commands and links to tutorials.

#### Testing
If the software includes automated tests, detail how to run those tests.
